# GooCocoonJSWebView

This is a project to test Goo in combination with CocoonJS and the WebView feature to display a HTML based UI on top of the main 3D scene.

## Some issues I encountered:

If I rename the WV.html file to webview.html the screen is black if cloud compiled and no Â§D scene is visible.

If I add the standard Goo style: #goo {position: absolute;top: 0px;left: 0px;bottom: 0px;right: 0px;width: 100%;height: 100%;text-transform: uppercase;}
The web view menu is not visible
